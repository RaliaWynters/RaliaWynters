# Welcome!

Hiya, thanks for stopping by :)

My name is Rin and I have been working in cybersecurity for around 3 years, and IT in general for about 6.
I started in application development doing mostly front-end development using Python and JavaScript, then eventually shifted into more devops and linux sysadmin work.
Eventually the skills involved in my day to day led me to learning more about cybersecurity and I've been doing that ever since. :)

My main areas of interest include Reverse Engineering and Digital Forensics
