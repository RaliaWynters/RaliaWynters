# Welcome!

Hiya, thanks for stopping by :)

My name is Ralia and I have been doing information security for around 2.5 years, and IT in general for about 5.
I started in application development doing mostly front-end development using Python and JavaScript, then eventually shifted into more devops and linux sysadmin work.
Eventually the skills involved in my day to day led me to learning more about information security and I've been doing that ever since. :)

My main areas of interest include Reverse Engineering and Digital Forensics, and these are the fields for which I spend most of my time researching.
I've taken the SANS FOR500 course, and will be taking FOR610 in June.

I'm relatively new to the blogging world, but a dream of mine is to be able to give great writeups and coverage for things in the reverse engineering and forensics world.
